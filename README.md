# ffrd-auto-reports
==============================


Automated reporting for FFRD HEC-RAS models

## **ðŸ“¢ REQUIRED READING**

This *README* provides crucial information for setting up and contributing to the auto_report project. It covers essential topics such as the dev-container setup, Python APIs, CLIs, authentication, running tests, linting, CI/CD, and formatting guidelines. If you haven't already, please read this document in it's entirety. It is necessary to ensure a smooth development process and maintain consistency across the project. If you do not understand something, reach out to someone who does!

## How to contribute

Review the following best practices for information on how to get your code merged! All code should follow the coding standards in the [Coding Standards](https://github.com/Denver-Automation-Analytics/software-design-and-best-practices/wiki/Coding-Standards). Please also review the [GitHub and Version Control](https://github.com/Denver-Automation-Analytics/software-design-and-best-practices/wiki/GitHub-and-Version-Control) wiki page. Please set up branch protection rules to enforce pull request reviews prior to merging into protected branches (especially if CI/CD is configured to run on some branches). If you require a *staging* branch, it may be helpful to set it as the default branch so pull request target that branch by default.

> Be sure your code is formatted with `black` and all linting and pytest checks pass before requesting a review of your code (see *Formatting Linting and Testing* below)

### Prerequisites

Before you can start developing, please make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Remote - Containers extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

### Setting up the Development Environment

- Make sure Docker Desktop is running.
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the project folder in VSCode.
- When prompted, click on "Reopen in Container" to open the project inside the devcontainer.
- If you don't see the prompt, you can manually open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and select "Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container".
- Wait for the devcontainer to build and start. This may take a few minutes if it is the first time you have opened the project in a container.

### Adding dependencies

Use the `env.yaml` file at the project root directory to keep pinned dependencies up-to-date and version controlled.

> Only include top level dependencies in this file (i.e. only packages you explicity want installed and use in your code) and Only inlcude the major.minor version (this allows all patches to automatically be applied when the project is rebuilt)

If your dependencies are more complex (i.e cannot be installed / managed with micromamba alone) you may need to update the `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` and apply similar modification to the production `Dockerfile`.

## Project Organization

This repository contains the source code for the various tools available through the `auto_report` package, cli, and Boathouse toolkit. This repository provides a Python API, CLI, and Boathouse interface to each tool.

### Python APIs

The Python API is accessed through the `auto_report` Python package. You will find the following in the `src/` folder related to the Python API:

- `auto_report` Python package
  - This is the main package in this repository
  - This package contains the Python APIs for each tool


## Authentication

In order to run the tools or tests, you must be authenticated with an AWS profile that has access to develop on this repository. You can request access keys from a project developer (preferred), or sign in on the CLI with your AWS SSO credentials for the DAA AWS account.

> If you are not authenticated, all tools and tests will fail to run and report **Unauthorized** to standard output.

If using project keys for authentication. Make a new file `.env` file in the root of the project directory (this file should not be commited to source control and is ignored in the `.gitignore`). Copy the format of the variables present in the `.env.template` file and fill in the necessary keys.


# Formatting Linting and Testing

This project uses `black` as the Python formatter. Before you merge your code into staging or main, you should make sure all your code is formatted by running the following command from the root of the project.

```
black .
```

This project includes a linter for Python called `pylint`. Your source code will be linted in the editor. To run the linter manually, run the following command from the root directory

```
pylint --fail-under=9 src*
```

To run the project tests, open a python file and click the tests button on the extensions panel of VSCode. You may need to configure the tests with the GUI. To do this, select *Configure Tests* and choose *pytest* as the testing framework and `tests` as the testing directory.

Once the tests are loaded, you can run them with the play button in the tests extension.

Alternatively, you can run the following command from the root directory to run all tests

```
pytest
```

## Notes on running standalone files / scripts

Normally, it is best to make a testing file under the `tests` folder to test functionality, but it is occasionally helpful to be able to run the scripts directly. In this case, you can change directories to the `src/` directory which will allow you to import files from the package or run standalone scripts that import files from the package:

```
cd src
python <- will open a python shell where "import my_package" will work
```

OR

```
cd src
python myscript.py <- the script can import code from my_package
```

## Building Dev Image

To test this image in Boathouse without pushing to staging or production branches, you can build it locally on Windows using the build-dev-image.ps1 script. First, you may need to set the execution policy

In powershell:

1. Set Execution Policy (If Needed): If you encounter an issue running scripts due to the execution policy, you can temporarily set it to unrestricted. Run the following command:

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

2. Run the Script: Once you are in the correct directory, run your PowerShell script using the following command:

```
.\build-dev-image.ps1
```

This will create a local docker image for auto_report tagged `dev` that will be available in Boathouse.
